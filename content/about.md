## Architecture Information

Designed by celebrated Brisbane architects Cottee Parker and built by RCQ Construction, one of Queensland’s most respected construction companies, Proximity Hamilton is a stunning 14-storey, 127-apartment tower in the exclusive Portside Wharf precinct.

- The building’s design was inspired by its proximity to the Brisbane River, and reflects the ripples created by a semi-submerged object in a flowing stream of water.
- Proximity's Architectural degisn with the woven-effect balconies and striking vertical aluminium battens deliver an ever-changing façade.
- The battens are inspired by the skeletal hulls of boats and as the ribs of a boat change along its length so too do these vertical battens change and warp along the length of the building.
- Subtle shifts in the spacing between each batten and subtle twists across each elevation add a sense of animation and individuality.
- Within the double-height lobby, residents’ mailboxes are created by Australian artist Brett Coelho and artistically dominate the space.
